## UI Library Of Choice - React Native Elements.

### A Brief Description of React Native Elements.
In my own words React Native Elements is a set of components like buttons and inputs that allow you to build your app more effiently.
The Library drastically reduces the need for multiple libraries as the components are supported on both Android and IOS.
It is practically a toolbox of useful parts and components for your desired application, that specialises in cross-compatibility.

## UI Library Of Choice - React Native Elements.

### Overview - A Brief Description of React Native Elements.
In my own words React Native Elements is a set of components like buttons and inputs that allow you to build your app more efficiently.
The Library drastically reduces the need for multiple libraries as the components are supported on both Android and IOS.
It is a toolbox of useful parts and components for your desired application, that specializes in cross-compatibility.

In The words of React Native Elements official documentation, "The aim of React Native Elements is to provide an all-in-one UI kit for creating apps in react native.
There are many great ui components made by developers all around open source. React Native Elements takes the hassle of assembling these packages together by giving
you a ready made kit with consistent api and look and feel. *"React Native Elements. (n.d.). The aim of React Native Elements is to provide an all-in-one UI kit for creating apps in react native.

### How to install React Native Elements.
Step 1: Setup Your environment/terminal. (I use Visual Studio Code, Expo and a Git Bash Terminal).

Step 2: Install the Stable Version of rneui.
``` npm install @rneui/themed @rneui/base ```

Step 3: Install Peer dependencies. Note: This step can be skipped if you are using Expo or Create-react-native-app
as they already contain such dependencies by default.
``` npm install react-native-vector-icons ``` 

Step 4: Install safe area context.
``` npm install react-native-safe-area-context ```

Step 5: Create a project. If you have an existing project simply install the package and its dependencies as above.
If you are trying to create a new project use the following for a React Native Elements template.
``` npx create-expo-app --template @rneui/template ```
